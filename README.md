# The Great Python Text Adventure

This "lockdown-project" is a text-based adventure game built from scratch in Python. It uses descriptive narrative to create a "choose-your-own-path" type storyline. The program includes: player profiles, menu interactions, multiple choice selections, character inventory, game saves, story creation and story sharing (using JSONs).

_This project is still a WIP, however it is fully-playable with the default in-built story._
